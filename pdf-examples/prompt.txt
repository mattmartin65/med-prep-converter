build an app to be used by gastroenterology medical clinics. the purpose of the app is to convert instructions on a pdf to a csv file. 
( this csv is used to populate another app  the 'other app' has already beed developed and expects the csv in a particular format, see attached csv file. The headings must match the headings in the example csv files attached. the steps should be similar to the examples provided in the csv).

I have attached 5 pdf files from different clinics. 
the format is different for every clinic. 
the pdf instructions will have the following common features:
-It will be for a particular bowel prep ( for example - Plenvu)
-each set of instruction are based around whether the colonoscopy is preformed before 12pm or after 12pm,  morning colonoscopy = morning or afternoon = afternoon
- instructions will have information for each step.
- steps have an order ( first step is 1. usually around 10 steps)
- each step has the number of days prior to the colonoscopy the step is performed ( usually ranges from 7 days before to the day of colonoscopy ( column called days where 7days before='-7' and  day of colonoscopy='0')
- steps may have a time associated with them.
- the instructions may refer to a split dose ( if split = true)
- csv has a column called 'category' . there are 4 categories as follows:
-medication = medications information that is not 'bowelprep medication' ( for example - blood thinners, blood pressure medication), 
-bowelprep ( this relates specifically to medication used to prepare patients bowel for the colonoscopy, for example-moviprep,glycoprep,prepkitc), 
- diet = information about what to eat
- procedure = information about colonoscopy
